          <p class="intro">Hi! I'm Aleilee Corona!</p>
					<p>I am a proud latina woman who is learning the art of coding. I am from a small town in San Diego, California called Ramona. It is a more rural area east of San Diego. One thing about me, I love to learn new things. I am dedicated to my work and will always try to overcome the obstacles that I face.</p>
          <p>With a biological sciences degree, I carry a great sense of critical thinking. Having a STEM background allows me to produce content on my own while also having the ability to work in a team with other strong minded individuals.</p>

            <p>Learning to code while in the Thinkful Bootcamp has taught me to learn new information at a fast pace while learning the technique to figure out different debuging situations so that I am a complex coder. Coding is in my blood. I think of coding as a puzzle. Solving puzzles take some time but in the end it is the best feeling to see the finished product. I would love to be able to create something amazing for a creative mind like mine. I believe I am able to create your vision and turn it into reality. </p>

           <p>When I'm not coding, I like to bake! I am a baker! I have mastered the Macaron. This french almond, meringue cookie is one of the hardest desserts to make! It takes time and effort to really get it right! I have created a side business making these macarons for people that want that special touch for their parties. Who doesn't love a sweet treat!</p>
